[11/09/22, 17:52:02] Krishna chaitanya: Sir, we are students of CS branch. Our Operating system sessional is scheduled day after tomorrow which was updated in LMS yesterday night. Some groups of CSE like in case of CS7 ,were informed priorly a week ago. When we asked for information regarding sessional ,our lab teachers and lecture profs said to wait for the notification in LMS. We have two sessionals tomorrow i.e., on Monday and if OS sessional with huge syllabus is conducted this near(Tuesday),  how would we prepare. Atleast info prior to 3_4 days would have helped us. Please reschedule OS sessional to this Friday or later. 
Thank you.

[17/09/22, 16:21:09] Krishna chaitanya: Respected sir, I am very sorry to express my dissatisfaction attempting the mid semester sessionals. We are from CSED and had completed almost all the mid sem sessionals, except one DSA programming exam. Starting from the first sessional of Discrete Mathematics itsef, the questions were out of syllabus, example no. of surjective functions, which was related to combinatorics(not in syllabus), but then it was reconducted so that got resolved. Then we asked for postponement of Operating system sessional due to lack of info regarding the sessional from the lab and lecture faculty. On requesting you, there appeared a reply mail which blamed us in turn saying teachers had already informed priorly. But, when we asked our lab faculty priorly regarding the same, they said they had no idea and same with the lecture faculty who said to rely on LMS. But on LMS it was informed too late to even revise all the chapters. And, the next thing is the platform on which the exam was conducted(it was Hackerrank, a competitive programming website)was not expected. But, still we managed to attempt it decently. Then yesterday, we had DSA sessional which was awful. It had no navigation, questions were so lengthy, although the questions were solvable the time constraint stopped us to do so. It was similar to JEE Advanced both in pattern and complexity and was not at all justifiable to have been conducted so. It was a disaster. On Monday, we have the programming exam of DSA which is to be conducted on code chef, again a competitive programming platform, and the duration is 2:30+1:30 hrs. The sample questions are similar to higher level programming questions. This is a sessional but doesnt look in that way, it seems to be some competitive exam. Particularly, in the case of DSA the paper is both logically complicated and time bounded beyond a level. Sir, sessional marks are to be added to the EST marks, and if the conduction of the exams continue like this our CGPA would seriously drop. Please, stop conducting the exams on these platforms, and conduct them in the normal pattern. And, it is also not at all justifiable to conduct the sessional of 10 marks for 2:30 hrs and on these platforms like ICPC exam or so. We are informing you with a valid proof, please check our scores(mainly of DSA sessional) for validation. Sir, we again request you please change the pattern of sessional from a competitive exam pattern, to a normal btech sessional pattern.
THANK YOU.

[19/11/22, 20:51:15] Shiya Mer GR Cs2: Lab evaluation will be held next week at the same timings as your lab. It will consists of 20 marks for which the breakup is as follows:
a. 5 marks for continuous evaluation/attendance/viva/file.
b. There will be two programs for 15 marks. One program will be of 7 marks and should be from the programs of Bisection, secant, NR, fixed point iteration method, Trapezoidal, Simpsons 1/3rd, Euler or RK4.
Second program will be of 8 marks and should be from the programs of Gauss Seidel, Gauss elimination, LU decomposition, power method, Lagrange or Newton divided difference interpolation.

Laptops will not be allowed.

You will write the code on MATLAB and algorithm on sheet..... No code on the sheet.

Everyone must be having lab files with them.

[23/03/23, 21:34:59] Rishita CS2: Ya toh number dedo

[23/03/23, 21:37:11] Rishita CS2: Haan toh kal attendance lene ki kya zarurat hai
[23/03/23, 21:37:17] Harshvir Singh: 😂😂

[23/03/23, 21:38:03] Krishna chaitanya: DOAA ka decision, maam ka decision he vo sab attendence kab Lena he kab nhi ..... Mein kya karu
[23/03/23, 21:38:06] Rishita CS2: Koi classes matlab
[23/03/23, 21:38:17] Krishna chaitanya: She is strict about the attendence
[23/03/23, 21:38:41] Krishna chaitanya: Baaki aana he nhi aane he apna marzi
[23/03/23, 21:39:18] Rishita CS2: Sab bheed ke liye kar rahe warna toh unhe bhi pata hai koi nhi aane wala
[23/03/23, 21:41:23] Krishna chaitanya: Thought the same but teachers have strict orders to attend their allotted groups.....so teachers are also strict about the attendence
[23/03/23, 21:47:44] Krishna chaitanya: Guys, maam is saying tomorrow you attend compulsory, about day after tomorrow she is saying she can't cancel the lab.....but if no one attends the class then lab shall be considered cancelled, and regarding the attendence if the coordinator finds that lab is not taking place as scheduled, then she can't mark us present hence she will mark all absent, but if the coordinator doesn't find this, then she will mark the day after tomorrow's attendence on the basis of tomorrow's. So it's our own risk, so please tell me what shall us do? I need to inform maam.
[23/03/23, 21:48:29] Krishna chaitanya: She also said, day after tomorrow there is a high probability of lab coordinator checking the scheduled labs.
[23/03/23, 21:48:48] Lovepreet: bhai ye kya matrix h?
[23/03/23, 21:48:58] Krishna chaitanya: 😂
[23/03/23, 21:50:52] Krishna chaitanya: And as soon as you reach track inform me once, hence I will mark your attendence, then maam will cross check it....she said she will inform me once she comes to the track .....I will message you all regarding the location and all, you come to maam!
[23/03/23, 22:49:20] Krishna chaitanya: Phir kal koun koun aarahe he?
[23/03/23, 23:49:06] Krishna chaitanya: Thoda jaldi aana 8:30 ko aise mein 8:50 thak final list banake maam ko bhejke chala jaunga.....aur apna marzi agar rehna he vha rho nhi toh nhi ....ye best he na
[23/03/23, 23:51:57] Krishna chaitanya: Andar math jao bahar hi rho.....easy to leave 😂.....I will inform you the location
[24/03/23, 08:47:18] Krishna chaitanya: If someone gets to the ground msg me
[24/03/23, 09:49:10] Krishna chaitanya: Who is there at the ground right now please reply immediately.
[24/03/23, 09:49:54] Krishna chaitanya: CN lab maam has also called me.....she is asking me if anyone's present at the ground can they meet me!

[24/03/23, 10:03:05] Krishna chaitanya: as it is already 10 no further attendance will be counted ..... so please don't go to the ground now!
[24/03/23, 10:24:53] Krishna chaitanya: There will be CN lab at 9:40 as usual tomorrow.
[24/03/23, 12:43:59] Krishna chaitanya: Read this it's below clause and tell me what shall us do for tomorrow's DBMS lab? Maam is asking me

[30/03/23, 13:24:23] Krishna chaitanya: She said there is no marking criterion related to submission so don't get tensed......submission is upto sunday
[30/03/23, 13:24:51] Krishna chaitanya: Submission is for the sake of atleast solving it once for assignment.....but submission is compulsory 😂
[30/03/23, 13:25:32] Krishna chaitanya: You can also solve it in live script at your homes or where ever you are.
[30/03/23, 13:26:20] Krishna chaitanya: * for practice (eval)

[31/03/23, 09:56:56] Krishna chaitanya: dont forget to submit network diagram with the other questions in the CN assignment.
[31/03/23, 21:32:17] Krishna chaitanya: If there is any issue regarding assignment 
X Y and Z connectivity.. considere X as main interconnection and you can continue the assignment 
Also I will change the submission deadline to 1st April
[31/03/23, 21:32:26] Krishna chaitanya: Cn lab maam
[31/03/23, 21:32:51] Krishna chaitanya: She is extending submission upto tomorrow i.e 1st April
[31/03/23, 21:36:52] Krishna chaitanya: If you are comfortable with given question's interpretation as y being interface b/w x and z then you can submit it.....for whom it seems to be a problem change it to x being main interface and solve it
[31/03/23, 21:37:04] Krishna chaitanya: This is what maam meant.
[01/04/23, 11:53:58] Krishna chaitanya: You can use oracle also for pl-sql ~DBMS maam.

[01/04/23, 20:19:14] ~ Ira: Pl/sql codes are not executing on our oracle live script , can you please confirm the platform jaha pe we can execute them @916304195822
[01/04/23, 21:07:05] Krishna chaitanya: Try to solve them in SQL database downloaded in your systems (that we used in the lab last time). Procedures can't be run in live script. I asked her that's why. But she has said you can do it on the live script platform. I will ask her again regarding this and tell you.
[01/04/23, 21:07:37] ~ Ira: Okk thank you !
[01/04/23, 21:58:54] Krishna chaitanya: In live there is no option for user input, if u r using live then give input in code.
[01/04/23, 21:58:55] Krishna chaitanya: If u download oracle then it will accept user input also.
